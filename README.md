The support form uses Supabase Edge Functions to handle support requests. The application is pre-configured to use the default Supabase Functions URL, but you can customize it by setting the environment variable:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variable (optional):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_FUNCTIONS_URL=your_supabase_functions_url
```

Note: If not provided, the application will use the default Supabase Functions URL configured in the project.
