### Social Media Sharing
The photo pages now support rich social media previews when shared on platforms like:
- Facebook Messenger
- WhatsApp
- Twitter/X
- LinkedIn
- Discord
- Slack
- And more...

When you share a photo URL (e.g., `https://myaiphotoshoot.com/photo/a41c8b83-c823-4738-9c6a-85a3e2397aba/`), the preview will show:
- The actual AI-generated photo as the preview image
- The prompt text as the description
- The website title and branding

#### How it works
Each photo page dynamically generates:
- **Open Graph meta tags** for Facebook, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, etc.
- **Twitter Card meta tags** for Twitter/X
- **Structured JSON-LD data** for search engines

#### Testing Social Sharing
To test the social sharing functionality:

1. **Facebook Sharing Debugger**: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/
   - Enter your photo URL and click "Debug" to see the preview

2. **Twitter Card Validator**: https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator
   - Enter your photo URL to validate the Twitter card

3. **LinkedIn Post Inspector**: https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/
   - Check how your links will appear on LinkedIn

4. **Open Graph Preview Tool**: https://www.opengraph.xyz/
   - Generic tool to test Open Graph tags

5. **WhatsApp**: Simply paste the URL in a chat to see the preview

#### Example URLs to test:
- `https://myaiphotoshoot.com/photo/a41c8b83-c823-4738-9c6a-85a3e2397aba/`
- Replace the ID with any photo ID from your gallery

**Note**: After deploying changes, it may take a few minutes for social platforms to update their cached previews. You can use the debugging tools above to force refresh the cache.

### Setting up Supabase for the Support Form

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variable (optional):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_FUNCTIONS_URL=your_supabase_functions_url
```

Note: If not provided, the application will use the default Supabase Functions URL configured in the project.
