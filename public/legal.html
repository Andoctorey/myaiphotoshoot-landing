            review any uploaded any generated content, and if we identify any content featuring
            minors, we will immediately remove such content and report any instances of potential
            child exploitation, endangerment, or abuse to the appropriate law enforcement
            authorities in your respective jurisdiction. By using our platform, you consent to such
            monitoring, review, and reporting, and you understand that you may be subject to legal
            repercussions if you violate these terms.</p>
        <p>Further, you shall not (directly or indirectly): (i) take any action that imposes or may

            restrictions are contrary to applicable law); and (vi) reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell,
            resell or exploit any portion of the Site, use of the Site, or access to the Site or any
            contact on the Site, without our express written permission.</p>
        <h2>DMCA and Takedowns Policy</h2>
        <p>My Ai Photo Shoot utilizes artificial intelligence systems to produce the Assets. Such

            investigate your request and take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium
            Copyright Act and other applicable intellectual property laws with respect to any
            alleged or actual infringement.</p>
        <h2>Modification of Terms of Service</h2>
        <p>At its sole discretion, My Ai Photo Shoot may modify or replace any of the Terms of
            Service, or change, suspend, or discontinue the Service (including without limitation,
            the availability of any feature, database, or content) at any time by posting a notice
            on the My Ai Photo Shoot websites or Service or by sending you an email. My Ai Photo
            Shoot may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to
            parts or all of the Service without notice or liability. It is your responsibility to
            check the Terms of Service periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Service
            following the posting of any changes to the Terms of Service constitutes acceptance of
            those changes.</p>
        <h2>Trademarks and Patents</h2>

            trademarks of My Ai Photo Shoot. All other trademarks mentioned in this website are the
            property of their respective owners. The trademarks and logos displayed on this website

            respective owners. Portions, features and/or functionality of My Ai Photo Shoot’s
            products may be protected under My Ai Photo Shoot patent applications or patents.</p>
        <h2>Licensing Terms</h2>
        <p>Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, the conditions herein and any limitations
            applicable to My Ai Photo Shoot or by law: (i) you are granted a non-exclusive, limited,
            non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-assignable, freely revocable license to access
            and use the Service for business or personal use; (ii) you own all Assets you create
            with the Services and (iii) we hereby assign to you all rights, title and interest in
            and to such Assets for your personal or commercial use. Otherwise, My Ai Photo Shoot
            reserves all rights not expressly granted under these Terms of Service. Each person must
            have a unique account and you are responsible for any activity conducted on your
            account. A breach or violation of any of our Terms of Service may result in an immediate
            termination of your right to use our Service.</p>
        <p>By using the Services, you grant to My Ai Photo Shoot, its successors, and assigns a
            perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit,
            prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and/or
            distribute text prompts and images you input into the Services, or Assets produced by
            the Service at your direction. This license authorizes My Ai Photo Shoot to make the
            Assets available generally and to use such Assets as needed to provide, maintain,
            promote and improve the Services, as well as to comply with applicable law and enforce
            our policies. You agree that this license is provided with no compensation paid to you
            by My Ai Photo Shoot for your submission or creation of Assets, as the use of the
            Services by you is hereby agreed as being sufficient compensation for the grant of
            rights herein. You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive,
            royalty-free license to access your publicly available Assets through the Service, and
            to use those Assets (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display, and perform
            it) only as enabled by a feature of the Service. The license to My Ai Photo Shoot
            survives termination of this Agreement by any party, for any reason.</p>
        <h2>Fees and Payments</h2>
        <p>You agree that My Ai Photo Shoot provide you immediate access to digital content and
            begins service consumption immediately upon purchase, without the standard 14-day
            withdrawal period. Therefore, you expressly waive your right to withdraw from this
            purchase. Due to the high costs of GPU processing, we're not able to offer refunds
            because we reserve servers and incur high costs for your usage immediately.</p>
        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>My Ai Photo Shoot may terminate your access to all or any part of the Service at any time
            if you fail to comply with these Terms of Service, which may result in the forfeiture
            and destruction of all information associated with your account. Further, either party
            may terminate the Services for any reason and at any time upon written notice. If you
            wish to terminate your account, you may do so by following the instructions on the
            Service. Any fees paid hereunder are non-refundable. Upon any termination, all rights
            and licenses granted to you in this Agreement shall immediately terminate, but all
            provisions hereof which by their nature should survive termination shall survive
            termination, including, without limitation, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and
            limitations of liability.</p>
        <h2>Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless My Ai Photo Shoot, its affiliates and each
            of its, and its affiliates employees, contractors, directors, suppliers and
            representatives from all liabilities, losses, claims, and expenses, including reasonable
            attorneys’ fees, that arise from or relate to (i) your use or misuse of, or access to,
            the Service, or (ii) your violation of the Terms of Service or any applicable law,
            contract, policy, regulation or other obligation. My Ai Photo Shoot reserves the right
            to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to
            indemnification by you, in which event you will assist and cooperate with My Ai Photo
            Shoot in connection therewith.</p>
        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL My Ai Photo Shoot OR ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS,
            SUPPLIERS OR CONTENT PROVIDERS, BE LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY,
            NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE (I) FOR
            ANY LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR
            SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND
            WHATSOEVER, OR SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, (II) FOR YOUR RELIANCE ON THE SERVICE OR
            (III) FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN EXCESS (IN THE AGGREGATE) OF THE FEES PAID BY YOU FOR
            THE SERVICE OR, IF GREATER, $500. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
            OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT
            APPLY TO YOU.</p>
        <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL My Ai Photo Shoot OR INTERIOR AI OR ITS OWNERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM,
            DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
            FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH USE OF THIS APPLICATION.</p>
        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>ALL USE OF THE SERVICE AND ANY CONTENT IS UNDERTAKEN ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE
            SERVICE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE My Ai Photo Shoot WEB APP AND ANY CONTENT)
            IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” AND IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
            IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
            NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY
            WARRANTIES IMPLIED BY ANY COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE, ALL OF WHICH ARE
            EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED
            WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
        <h2>Age Requirements</h2>
        <p>By accessing the Services, you confirm that you’re at least 18 years old and meet the
            minimum age of digital consent in your country. If you are not old enough to consent to
            our Terms of Service in your country, your parent or guardian must agree to this
            Agreement on your behalf.</p>
        <p>Please ask your parent or guardian to read these terms with you. If you’re a parent or
            legal guardian, and you allow your teenager to use the Services, then these terms also
            apply to you and you’re responsible for your teenager’s activity on the Services. No
            assurances are made as to the suitability of the Assets for you.</p>
        <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
        <p>The Terms of Service are the entire agreement between you and My Ai Photo Shoot with
            respect to the Service, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and
            proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and My Ai Photo Shoot with
            respect to the Service. If any provision of the Terms of Service is found to be
            unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum
            extent necessary so that the Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and
            effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right
            provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. My Ai
            Photo Shoot shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder due
            to any cause beyond My Ai Photo Shoot’s reasonable control. The Terms of Service are
            personal to you, and are not assignable or transferable by you except with My Ai Photo
            Shoot’s prior written consent. My Ai Photo Shoot may assign, transfer or delegate any of
            its rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency, partnership, joint
            venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Terms of Service and
            neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. Except as
            otherwise provided herein, all notices under the Terms of Service will be in writing and
            will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by
            certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically
            confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or two days after it is sent, if sent
            for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.</p>

        <p>Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration</p>
        <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</p>
        <ol type="1" start="1">
            <li>Agreement to Arbitrate.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms as
            the “Arbitration Agreement.” You and My Ai Photo Shoot agree that any and all disputes,
            claims, demands, or causes of action (“Claims”) that have arisen or may arise between
            you and us, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Site, or any aspect
            of the relationship or transactions between us, will be resolved exclusively through
            final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator, rather than in a court by a
            judge or jury, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that
            you or we may (but are not required to) assert individual Claims in small claims court
            if such Claims are within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction. Further, this
            Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of
            federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief
            against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and we are
            each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action and that
            our respective rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.
            The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
            Arbitration Agreement.</p>
        <p>You agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to these Terms, the
            Site, or any services provided must be filed within one (1) year after the event or
            facts giving rise to the claim or cause of action occurred. To the extent permitted by
            applicable law, any claims or causes of action not filed within this period are
            permanently barred.</p>
        <ol type="1" start="1">
            <li>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualised Relief.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL
            BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
            ACTION OR PROCEEDING.</p>
        <ol type="1" start="1">
            <li>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Before commencing any arbitration (or suit in small claims court, if available), you
            agree to provide My Ai Photo Shoot with a written notice of Claim, and My Ai Photo Shoot
            agrees to provide you with a written notice of Claim to the extent reasonably possible
            based on the availability of your contact information to My Ai Photo Shoot (“Notice”).
            The Notice to My Ai Photo Shoot shall be sent to <a href="mailto:support@myaiphotoshoot.com">support@myaiphotoshoot.com</a>.
            Where My Ai Photo Shoot has your contact information, My Ai Photo Shoot will send its
            Notice to you using the last email address we have on file for you if you have provided
            us with an email address (each, a “Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the
            nature and basis of the Claim in sufficient detail to evaluate the merits of the
            claiming party’s Claim and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought, including the
            amount of money (if any) that is demanded and the means by which the demanding party
            calculated the claimed amount. Both parties agree that they will attempt to resolve a
            Claim through informal negotiation within sixty (60) calendar days from the date the
            Notice is received. If the Claim is not resolved within sixty (60) calendar days after
            the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding. Each party
            agrees that state and federal courts in Singapore, may enter injunctive relief to
            enforce the pre-filing requirements of this paragraph, including an injunction to stay
            an arbitration that has been commenced in violation of this paragraph.</p>
        <ol type="1" start="1">
            <li>Arbitration Procedures.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Federal Arbitration Act fully applies to the Arbitration Agreement. The arbitration
            will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration
            Association’s (“AAA”) Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time that such
            arbitration is initiated (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this
            Arbitration Agreement. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes
            can be found on the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, <a
                    href="http://www.adr.org/consumer">http://www.adr.org/consumer</a>. If there is
            any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration
            Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control. The
            arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would. Except as
            set forth above, all issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited
            to, threshold issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
            Arbitration Agreement and issues relating to (a) whether the terms of these Terms (or
            any aspect thereof) are enforceable, unconscionable, or illusory and (b) any defence to
            arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. During arbitration
            proceedings, the amount of any settlement offer made by My Ai Photo Shoot or you shall
            not be disclosed to the arbitrator. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler
            and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can
            award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an
            individual under these Terms and applicable law. While an arbitrator may award
            declaratory or injunctive relief, the arbitrator may do so only with respect to the
            individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
            warranted by the individual party’s Claim. The arbitrator’s decision and judgment
            thereon will not have a precedent or collateral estoppel effect on any other Claim.
            Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court
            only for very limited reasons. Any arbitration hearings will take place in Singapore, at
            another mutually agreeable location or, if both parties agree, by telephone or video
            conference. Whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents
            submitted to the arbitrator or by a hearing will be determined in accordance with the
            AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the
            arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
            findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>
        <ol type="1" start="1">
            <li>Small Claims Court.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, either party may elect to pursue a
            Claim in a local small claims court rather than through arbitration so long as the
            matter remains in a small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis.</p>
        <ol type="1" start="1">
            <li>Cost of Arbitration.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration
            Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration
            Agreement. If you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator’s satisfaction that you are
            economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator
            otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion
            of the Arbitration Fees, we will pay your portion of such fees, subject to allocation in
            the arbitrator’s award. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs
            of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay
            as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the
            arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed
            by the AAA Rules.</p>
        <ol type="1" start="1">
            <li>Confidentiality.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each of the parties shall maintain the strictly confidential nature of the arbitration,
            including all aspects of the arbitration proceeding and any ruling, decision, or award
            by the arbitrator, and shall not (without the prior written consent of the other party)
            disclose to any third party the fact, existence, content, award, or other results of the
            arbitration, except as may be necessary to enforce, enter, or challenge such award in a
            court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise required by law.</p>
        <ol type="1" start="1">
            <li>Opt Out.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You may reject this Arbitration Agreement, in which case only a court may be used to
            resolve any Claim. To reject this provision, you must send us an opt-out notice (the
            “Opt Out”) within thirty (30) days after you first access the Site. The Opt-Out must be
            sent to the My Ai Photo Shoot Notice Address. The Opt-Out must include your name, phone
            number and the email address you used to sign up and use the Site. This is the only way
            of opting out of this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out will not affect any other aspect
            of these Terms and will have no effect on any other or future agreements you may reach
            to arbitrate with us.</p>
        <ol type="1" start="1">
            <li>Severability.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration
            Agreement (other than Paragraph 2) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative
            Actions and Non-Individualised Relief” is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to
            replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable,
            and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
            or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a
            court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of Paragraph 2 above, titled
            “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualised Relief” are
            invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null
            and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with
            respect to Claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms will
            continue to apply.</p>
        <p>Choice of Law</p>
        <p>Any and all Claims shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the internal
            substantive laws of Singapore in all respects, without regard for the jurisdiction or
            forum in which the user is domiciled, resides or located at the time of such access or
            use. Except as provided in the Arbitration Agreement, all Claims will be brought in the
            federal or state courts in Singapore, and you and My Ai Photo Shoot each
            unconditionally, voluntarily, and irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal
            jurisdiction and venue of those courts.</p>
        <p>YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
            JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS
            THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, AS SET FORTH ABOVE.</p>
        <p>A printed version of these Terms and any other notice given in electronic form will be
            admissible in any arbitral, judicial, or administrative proceedings based upon or
            relating to these Terms and your use of the Site to the same extent and subject to the
            same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and
            maintained in printed form.</p>
        <p>Waiver and Severability</p>
        <p>If you do not comply with a portion of these Terms and we do not take action right away,
            this does not mean we are giving up any of our rights under these Terms. If any part of
            these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
            jurisdiction or arbitrator, the remainder of the Terms shall be enforced to the maximum
            extent permitted by law.</p>
        <p>Entire Agreement; Construction</p>
        <p>These Terms contain the entire agreement between you and My Ai Photo Shoot regarding your
            use of the Site and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications,
            or understandings between you and My Ai Photo Shoot on that subject.</p>
        <p>Assignment and Delegation</p>
        <p>You may not assign or delegate these Terms or any rights or obligations under these
            Terms. Any attempted or purported attempted assignment or delegation shall be null and
            void and will automatically terminate your right to use the Site. We may assign or

        <p>Changes to these Terms</p>
        <p>We may change or modify these Terms by posting a revised version on the Site or by
            otherwise providing notice to you, and we will state at the top of the revised Terms the

            privacy protection we're committed to under this Privacy Statement. To comply with laws

            needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual
            retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or
            consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable
            users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations. As part of our normal
            operations, your information may be stored in computers in other countries outside of

            you're under 13. Do not provide it to us. If your child is under 13 and you believe your
            child has provided us with their personal information, please contact us to have such
            information removed.</p>
